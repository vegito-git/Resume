Hello, I have done the webpage using html, css and bootstrap.
I have shown all the details as mentioned.
Basically I have used the row and col the most to separate the different parts. 
Also I have used the border property to make that vertical line in the middle. 
And I have put no border on small screen.
Thanks for reading & have a nice day!!
